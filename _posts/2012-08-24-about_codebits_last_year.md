Last year I attended [codebits](https://codebits.eu) for the first time. It was amazing! It's the technology conference you shouldn't miss if you're in Portugal. 

It's not a three days straight in front of a computer wearing smelly clothes. It may seem like, it may also be like it, but it is much more. Just remembering the awesome nyan cat moment. The hunt for badges. Stuff to win. O'Reilly's book at half the price. Many talks and challenges. And strange people, just how I like it.

I came back with a bag full of shirts and great ideas for the next year. Looking forward to see what's new. Beware the tacos!
